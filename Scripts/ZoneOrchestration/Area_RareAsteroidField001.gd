#Rare asteroid field spawns asteroids with better mineral spawns.
#Right now they're hard-added in the inspector - 3 asteroids that spawn iron and silver, 
#one that spawns silver n gold,
#one that spawns all of the above + platinum

#upon testing it looks like only iron is spawning?  Maybe silver as well?


#also added a glowy sprite for a background to give the player an indication that this area 
# is special.  I imagine there's a way to do this that might already be in planning
#The sprite used for this is placed here "res://Lights/Textures/rare_asteroid_field_glow.png"
#not sure if that's a good spot for it
