name="VAM Item Smith"
description="A tool custom built for producing items in the game VAM Empire, developed by Hometeam GameDev : Lighthouse.

Item Smith seeks to streamline the process from 
taking a pixel art .png file + icon and turning them into
a full game asset, with a *.tscn file, some standard 
properties to be compatible with the in-game inventory
system and then allow for the addition of unlimited
custom properties that can be used as developers 
at Hometeam desire!"
