Inventory Design

Pieces of the inventory and their purpose

- Inventory
	- Visually Organize Slots and Buttons
	- Display Ship Paperdoll
	- Manage PlayerVars.* representation of inventory to be saved

- Slots
	- Occupied/Free
		- If Occupied use InventoryItem to determine behavior (I.e. Can stack, swap held item with stored item etc..)
	- Mouse Input on Slots (Get rid of input on items themselves... So Items can likely become simple TextureRects, make Slots Buttons)
	
- Items
	- Item Type [ Cargo, Weapon, etc ]
	- Item Uuid (Ties back into the Database as well as makes grouping for stacking easier)
	- Item Count
	- Stack Size
	
- Paperdoll
	- Display Current ship with an animated background
	- Equipped Weapons organized as "Items" in Slots
	- Equipped Thrusters organized as "Items" in Slots
	- Equipped Ship Modules organized as "Items" in Slots
	- Ship "Items" can be rearranged or moved into Inventory
	- Hovering over "Item" should highlight part on ship if it exists visually (Weapons, Thrusters)
